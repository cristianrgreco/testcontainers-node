# Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library.
It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents.

## Examples

Check out the [jest test](elasticsearch-container.test.ts) to see how to start the container and connect
to the Elasticsearch node with the JavaScript client.
